### Mobile Price Range Prediction: A Classification Analysis

These days, mobile phones have become one of the most widely bought and sold devices. Each day sees the introduction of new mobiles featuring updated versions and enhanced capabilities. A multitude of mobile devices are bought and sold on a daily basis. As a result, accurately estimating and predicting prices is a crucial aspect of consumer strategy. When introducing a new product, it is essential to set the right price to ensure that consumers perceive it as reasonable for purchase. Unfortunately, when buying mobile phones, individuals often struggle to make informed decisions due to a lack of accessible resources for price validation. To tackle this challenge, we have developed various classification models utilizing data pertaining to different features of mobile phones. The constructed model is then employed to forecast the price range for new mobile phones. The primary goal of this study is to establish a correlation between the features of a mobile phone and its corresponding price range, categorizing it as either cheap (0), mid-range (1), expensive (2), or very expensive (3). Various classification models will be employed to ensure the precise classification of data into the appropriate price ranges.
